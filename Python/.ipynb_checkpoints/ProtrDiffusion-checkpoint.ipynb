    "# Heterogenous diffusion: 1D\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating what might be happening in the protrusion w/ a spatially heterogenous diffusion constant (ie a nonhomogenous diffusion tensor).  I'll start this off with a simple 1D simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is not intended to be a rigorous simulation.* It's merely a pilot to get a flavor for the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define:\n",
    "- **Positive curvature** = curving away from the original host cell's center\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume:\n",
    "- Fusogen is injected into the membrane and can freely diffuse (ie not physically tethered to anything)\n",
    "    - Further assume that fusogen is injected into the very center of the protrusion tip\n",
    "- Protrusion shape is torus inner quarter for base, cylinder for body, hemisphere for cap\n",
    "- For practicality, fusogens that diffuse significantly beyond the base will just \"fall off the edge of the world\" and be dropped from the sim\n",
    "    - We'll make the sim world end at 1 side length from the edge of \"the base\"\n",
    "- For simplicity, the diffusion coefficient will be homegenous w/i the cap, the body, the base, and the outside buffer\n",
    "- No collisions between fusogens.  Presumably the real fusogen machinery is injected at vanishingly low concentration relative to the membrane size, and so I'm really just interested in the probability of finding a fusogen at any given location over time, not their true dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unfurl our 1D protrusion curve:\n",
    "- The protrusion dimensions: ~4 um long, ~0.5 um cap radius of curvature, ~0.25 um base radius of curvature\n",
    "    - $4 - 0.5 - 0.25 = 3.25 \\mu m$ long sides x2 = length of outside buffer x2\n",
    "    - $\\frac{1}{2} 2 \\pi 0.5 = 0.5 \\pi \\mu m$ half-circumference for the central cap\n",
    "    - $\\frac{1}{4} 2 \\pi 0.25 = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\mu m$ quarter-circumference x2 for the base\n",
    "\n",
    "Test:\n",
    "- Fusogen has preference for positive curvature --> lower diffusion coefficient in positive curvature (higher binding energy w/ the membrane there); higher diffusion coefficient in negative curvature\n",
    "- Fusogen has preference for negative curvature --> lower diffusion coefficient in positive curvature (higher binding energy w/ the membrane there); higher diffusion coefficient in negative curvature\n",
    "- A stricly 1D test would keep the diffusion coefficient equal between the body and the buffer.  However, I want this to be a little more directly applicable to my real 2D situation, so I'm going to make them different in keeping with the different curvatures IRL\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the diffusion model I did in Hernan's class, I'm going to model the diffusion as hopping between boxes with rate:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} N(i,t) = k_{i-1} N(i-1,t) + k_{i+1} N(i+1,t) - 2 k_{i} N(i,t)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the the first two terms represent flow into box i from its neighbors and the last term represents the flow out from box i to its neighbors"
