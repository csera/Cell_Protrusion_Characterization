Done using BaseFusionPrePost.ipynb v1.1.1

Changes from 1.0:
- Fixed computations using the actual torus curvature (prev "Method 1")
	- Needed to array index zRim, rim_rt, and all dependent arrays
	- Solution now converges as the zRim resolution is increased 
		(left at 100 steps over each zRim range which seemed sufficient)
- Removed "Method 2" since the first approach now works

Still in question:
- NOTE: This solution for post-fusion energy only includes the protrusion's
	new toroidal rim.  It does NOT include the new fusion pore.  I've 
	emailed Christoph to see what he thinks.
