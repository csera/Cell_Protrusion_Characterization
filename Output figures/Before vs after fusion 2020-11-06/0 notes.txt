"Postfusion rims Gs.png" shows the bending energies of the...
- rim formed on the protrusion that was just cut off
- rim formed on the bulk side that is basically a fusion pore now
	- calculated both via Kozlov 1989 and via my Reimann sum method

To get GPost, the fusion pore energy is now added to the protrusion rim Gb
- done using only my solution to the pore Gb

The min path on the DGb surface is recognized by simple inspection to be the one
going along one of the edges where either the protrusion rim rt or the pore rim
rt is at a max.  Since it seems more reasonable to let the fusion pore rt be 
huge than the protrusion remnant's and to keep it consistent w/ the other
segments' plots, I chose to take the min path as Gb vs portrusion rim rt with
pore rt held constant at its max.

Of note for the compilation too, this now looks at rim_rt with finer spacing.
Rather than using a list of manually defined rim_rt's, this now uses 
numpy.linspace() to generate 100 pts b/w 2-45 nm
