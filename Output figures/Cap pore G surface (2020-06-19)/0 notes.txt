This was done using v2.1.0 of FusionPoreExpanG.ipynb

Note that the plots directly comparing a cap pore vs a flat pore depict the 
"grounded" energies.  That is, the surfaces were both shifted such that their 
minimum energies once the pore has formed (ie r>0) are both = 0.  This allows
more effective and direct comparison of their shapes and scale of slopes which is
really what we're interested in.
In the direct comparison surfaces, the blue hues surface is the flat pore, and 
the orange hues surface is the cap pore. Also note that the flat pore has been 
shifted up by 5 kT to make both surfaces visible. (They would overlap almost 
perfectly otherwise.)

I'm pretty sure that chatter in "Cap v flat pore - net G min paths restr dom.png" 
is simply from floating point rounding errors.
