Adapted from "Membrane approach 3.nb" - ie v1.3 of my computations 
of membrane interaction pressures in Mathematica
	Made using MembrApproach.py v1.0

Did this adaptation to a) have it in a non-proprietary language and b)
be able to more easily tweak the plot settings

The math is exactly the same as in the Mathematica nb except:
- Only the Rand undulation pressure is computed

- The code now explicitly defines the points to compute values at
