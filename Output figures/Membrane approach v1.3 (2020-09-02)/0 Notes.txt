Change from v1.2:
Using Kb = 15 kT instead of 10 kT to make consistent w/ value used
in rest of paper

For imgs not comparing against ABM:
blue = hydration pressure
yellow = undulation pressure (either according to Helfrich's eq or Rand's eq)
green = van der Waals attraction pressure
orange = net intermembrane interaction

For vs ABM imgs:
Blue = net intermembrane interaction 
	(using either Helfrich's eq or Rand's eq for undulation pressure)
Yellow = ABM pressure
