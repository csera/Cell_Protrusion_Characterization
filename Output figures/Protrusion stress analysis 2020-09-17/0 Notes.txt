Changes from v3.1
I had defined the angle in the Cos() wrong again...
To compensate for using the bottom half of the torus when the (+) dir
of the angle defined in Kobayashi's Diff Geom was toward the "top half",
I had been doing \pi - arcsin(f(z)).
However, this was not what I wanted and was giving results that didn't
square w/ sanity checks against the fact that the narrower part should
have greater curvature.
The angle in the cos() is now defined by simply taking -arcsin(f(z)).
	The plots now square w/ the above sanity check
